UI is a free open-source project for downloading video and audio from a lot of sites.
I build it for myself to learn how to programing and to work with Github.
So.. dont expect too much xD

I build this program using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) for me and my friends, because they are not really programers, and cant always use cmd
